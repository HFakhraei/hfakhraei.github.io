## Solving LeetCode Problem 189: Rotate Array (Part 2)
Welcome back to the second part of our series on solving Leetcode Problem 189, Rotate Array. In this video, we'll introduce an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n).

### Problem Description
Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```
**Constraints:**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 105
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
0 <= k <= 105
```
### Solution
<pre><code class="language-java">
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        int[] result = new int[nums.length];
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; nums.length; i++) {
            result[(i + k) % nums.length] = nums[i];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; nums.length; i++) {
            nums[i] = result[i];           
        }
    }
}
